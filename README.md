# Pizza-API

Very simple CRUD api for a fictional pizza service

## Setup

The setup is fairly simple:

Install the node packages using either `npm install` or `yarn install`.

## Usage

### Development

Run the development server using the following command:

> yarn dev

### Production

Build the production server using the following command:

> yarn build

Run the production server using the following command:

> yarn start

## Routing

The routes are documented using swagger which can be found using the following URL during development:

> http://localhost:8080/docs

During production the docs will be on the server at the same path `/docs`.

## Contributing

Not much to contribute but the swagger documentatin itself and tests.

Problems:

- Swagger schemas are not working properly and I don't know how to fix that.

## License

This project is licensed under the `no license yet` License. Will get fixed at some point in the future.
